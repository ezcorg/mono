# Steve

Steve is a cute little monkey companion that tries his best to help you. 

He'll offer you tips, encouragement, and a bit of fun along the way.

Take care of him, and he'll take care of you!

## Ideas

- [ ] Steve will give you daily quests that you can complete in order to earn rewards (you can cheat if you want, but you won't just be letting _yourself_ down, you'll be letting Steve down too)
- [ ] Steve will help you plan and track your goals, and remind you to stay on track
- [ ] When you complete quests or achieve goals, you earn points to take care of Steve
- [ ] If you don't feed Steve, he gets sad and unmotivated
- [ ] You can customize Steve's appearance and personality based on your preferences
- [ ] You can can send Steve on trips to explore the world and bring back souvenirs (he'll even send you postcards)
- [ ] When you invite or add friends, your Steves can go on playdates together
