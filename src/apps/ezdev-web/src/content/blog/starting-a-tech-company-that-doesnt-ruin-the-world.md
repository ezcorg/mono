If you're someone who has worked in the tech industry (or any industry, really), you've probably borne witness to the many ways in which the products you've built can be harmful. 

Worse still, you've probably seen that harm be *intentional*, often driven by decisions to prioritize profit over people (i.e., someone decides human suffering isn't worth that much).

I'm not going to list _all_ the reasons behind why I think this occurs, but I believe that it's enabled the most by one thing we can change:

## Corporate hierarchy

In the current meta where executives and majority share holders rule with little accountability (often paying fines rather than facing any real consequences), it's difficult for employees to do much to meaningfully influence company direction beyond resigning (*something which is generally regarded as a bad idea in the current job market*). Some triumph and occasionally manage to steer the ship away from the icebergs, but many others are forced to watch powerlessly as Leonardo DiCaprio freezes to death in the North Atlantic.

Network effects, walled-gardens, and lack of competition (due to ineffective and oft unenforced US antitrust law) make it difficult for consumers to vote with their wallets.

Over-representation of psychopathic traits in leadership roles often means that the people who are in charge of making these decisions are the least empathetic, and thus more likely to assign a low cost to the harming others (or alternatively, a higher value to risk & profit).

Conveniently, excessive layers of middle-management provide a way for non-decision makers to absolve themselves of any responsibility they might feel for their involvement, placing the blame at the feet of their masters instead.

Even with the best of intentions, the pressure to perform, meet targets, or satisfy fiduciary duties can lead to decisions that prioritize local profits over global well-being.

Maximizing personal gain regardless of the societal cost eventually leads to a pretty large tab for humanity to pay, with the ones who ordered fancy cocktails, multiple appetizers, and expensive entrees footing the smallest portion of the bill.


## The solution

Abolish the hierarchy.

Or, at least, the artificial kind that exists in most companies today.

Create flatter (_or other interestingly-shaped_) organizations to add checks and balances on power. Build a community where every member has a voice, and where decisions are made collaboratively rather than top-down. Incentivize participation, punish apathy and exploitation. 

Let experts in their fields make decisions they're best equipped to make, and defer to others for those they're not.

Be transparent. Be accountable.

Don't be evil.
