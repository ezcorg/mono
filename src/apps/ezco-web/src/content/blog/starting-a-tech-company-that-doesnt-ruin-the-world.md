If you're someone who has worked in the tech industry (or any industry, really), you've probably borne witness to the many ways in which the products you've built can be harmful. 

Worse still, you've probably seen that harm be *intentional*, often driven by decisions to prioritize profit over people.

I'm not going to list _all_ the reasons behind why I think this occurs, but I believe that it's enabled the most by one thing we can change:

## Corporate hierarchy

In the current corporate meta where big company executives and majority share holders rule with little accountability, it's difficult for employees to do much to meaningfully influence an organizations direction beyond resigning (*something which is generally regarded as a bad idea in the current job market*). Some occasionally triumph and manage to steer the ship, but many others are forced to watch helplessly as their C-suite drown Leonardo DiCaprio in the North Atlantic.

Network effects, walled-gardens, and lack of competition (due to ineffective and oft unenforced US antitrust law) make it difficult for consumers to vote with their wallets.

Over-representation of psychopathic traits in leadership roles means that the people who are in charge of making decisions are the least empathetic, and more likely to assign a low cost to suffering of others.

Conveniently, excessive layers of middle-management provide a way for non-decision makers to absolve themselves of any responsibility they might feel for their involvement, placing the blame at the feet of their masters instead.

Even with the best of intentions, the pressure to perform, meet targets, or satisfy fiduciary duties can lead to decisions that prioritize local profits over global well-being.

Maximizing growth above all has led to a pretty large tab for humanity to pay, with the ones who ordered fancy cocktails and multiple entrees now conveniently missing.


## The solution

Abolish the hierarchy.

Or, at least, the unnatural kind that exists in most companies today.

Create flat (_or other interestingly-shaped_) organizations to add checks and balances on power. Build communities where every member has a voice, and where decisions are made collaboratively rather than top-down. Incentivize participation, punish apathy and exploitation.

Let experts in their fields make decisions they're best equipped to make, and defer to others for those they're not.

Be transparent. Be accountable.

Don't be evil.
