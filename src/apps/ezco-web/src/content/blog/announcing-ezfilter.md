I am addicted to Instagram and YouTube reels.

I don't particularly enjoy the time I spend watching them, but I still routinely find myself going through spells of filling any emptiness with their presence. Vicarious experiences replace my desire for genuine human connection and relationships. The thoughts and ambitions of others satiate my own. Everything fights for my attention, and my attention spreads thin.

I am protected only by the algorithm; but the algorithm seeks to maximize my value to the business.

It will calculate a course of action based on what it knows about me (and others) to derive as much value as possible. Bean counters have invested in policies which aim at increasing my time spent on their platforms, regardless of its impact on my health. Without regulation, this is the end game of every business where higher engagement implies better monetization. It's a model which guarantees my privacy will be invaded in an effort to understand me, and that my sovereignty will be violated in an effort to subvert my free will.

It's "free"-ness is frictionless and seductive. It presents a deal too good to be true: endless content, without cost. "I'm strong enough to avoid the temptations, I'm smart, I use adblockers, I'm getting the better end of this deal!"

No, Theo, you are a stupid monkey. That banana comes from large corporations who use "data-driven" action as a cover to be absolved of responsibility. Do you really think it will be free?
