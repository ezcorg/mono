## Components

- [ ] `import`, a component which "imports" data into the current document (syntax: ````import [uri]````)
  * This is how we populate the document with references to external resources (mainly files)
- [ ] `calendar`, a component which displays events within the current system calendar (syntax: undecided, but likely ````calendar [date-range]...````)
