# dev

polyrepo containing all of the organization's projects and code.

until such a time that security or other needs require it, this repo is visible to anyone internally, and we should prefer to adopt a "public by default" policy for all code.

# development

clone the repo, create a branch, and start working on your changes. when you're done, push the branch and open a pull request.
